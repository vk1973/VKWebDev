// This "Main.js" is the main container that will have the search box, CardArray with all robots and Card.js for individual robots
// Main.js has to create a link between what is entered in search box and thr robots list so that only those that match the search text
// are shown
// React JS is componenbased. A UI is made of many components. React controls all data exchange across components with states and props
// Props are similar to parameters in JS functions. Their value cannot be changed. 
// State is like a data store in React. A State can be set when an event occurs. React.component is the base class for all class based
// React components. 
// when a component class inherits base class, the default state value (null) is set
// the state can be changed by overriding constructor method of the class. Setstate keyword is used to set the state when an event
// occurs
// in this example, we will use class based component and not function based component since the state needs to be set when an event 
//occurs
